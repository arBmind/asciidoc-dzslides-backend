= dzslides backend for AsciiDoc

An AsciiDoc backend that renders the AsciiDoc source as a dzslides presentation.
dzslides is modern presentation framework based on HTML5 and CSS3.

This backend is designed to work specifically with the following fork of the
dzslides project: https://github.com/mojavelinux/dzslides.

== Installation

To install the dzslides backend, download
https://github.com/downloads/mojavelinux/asciidoc-dzslides-backend/dzslides.zip[dzslides.zip]
and install it using the asciidoc command (you will need AsciiDoc version 8.6.6 or
newer):

----
asciidoc --backend install dzslides.zip
----

Next, make a symlink to dzslides in that folder.

----
cd ~/.asciidoc/backends/dzslides
ln -s /path/to/dzslides .
----

If you enable the linkcss attribute, then the symlink should be added in the
same directory as the presentation.

== Usage

Use the 'dzslides' backend as you would the built-in backends.
